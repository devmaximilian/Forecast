# Forecast

This package is a wrapper for the PMP3g API provided by [SMHI](https://smhi.se).

### Usage

Add Forecast to your `Package.swift` manifest.

```swift
...
/// Append the package to the list of dependencies
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/devmaximilian/Forecast.git", from: "0.4.0")
],

/// Append the library to the list of target dependencies
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyProject",
        dependencies: ["Forecast"])
]
...
```

Note that this is just a simple example demonstrating how the library can be used.

```swift
var cancellables: [String: AnyCancellable] = [:]

/// Request the current weather forecast for Stockholm
let forecastPublisher = ForecastPublisher(latitude: 59.3258414, longitude: 17.7018733)

cancellables["forecast-request"] = forecastPublisher
    .assertNoFailure()
    .sink { observation in
        /// Use the current forecast
        guard let forecast = observation.timeSeries.current else { return }
        
        /// Get the air temperature
        let temperature = forecast[.airTemperature]
        
        /// Use the air temperature in some way
        print("It is currently \(temperature)Â°C")
    }
```
