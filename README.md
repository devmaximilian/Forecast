# Weather

This package is a wrapper for the PMP3g API provided by [SMHI](https://smhi.se).

### Usage

Add Weather o your `Package.swift` manifest.

```swift
/// Append the package to the list of dependencies
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/devmaximilian/Weather.git", from: "1.0.0")
],

/// Append the library to the list of target dependencies
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "MyProject",
        dependencies: ["Weather"])
]
```

Note that this is just a simple example demonstrating how the library can be used.

```swift
var cancellables: [String: AnyCancellable] = [:]

/// Request the current weather forecast for Stockholm
let weatherPublisher = Weather.publisher(latitude: 59.3258414, longitude: 17.7018733)

cancellables["weather"] = weatherPublisher
    .assertNoFailure()
    .sink { weather in
        /// Get the current air temperature
        let temperature = observation.get(\.value, for: .t)
        
        /// Use the air temperature in some way
        print("It is currently \(temperature)Â°C")
    }
```
